Look up the ```chunks/{{chunkName}}/chunk.json``` file and open it up.

Inside this file, look for the **{{routeName}} route** element. It should look something like this:

```  
"routes": {
  "{{routeName}}": {
    ...
  }
}
```

Next, find the **title** element, which should look like this:

```  
"routes": {
  "{{routeName}}": {
    ...
    "title": "{{route.title}}"
    ...
  }
}
```

Then simply change the **{{route.title}}** value of the **route title** to something else.
