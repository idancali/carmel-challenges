 Look up the ```chunks/{{chunkName}}/chunk.json``` file once again and open it up.

 Inside this file, look once again for the **{{routeName}} route** element. Remember, it should look something like this:

 ```  
 "routes": {
   "{{routeName}}": {
     ...
   }
 }
 ```

 Now, find the **cover** element within the **{{routeName}} route**. Here's how it should look:

 ```  
 "routes": {
   "{{routeName}}": {
     "cover": {
       ...
       "title": "{{route.cover.title}}"
       ...
     }
   }
 }
 ```

Great, then simply set the **{{route.cover.title}}** value of the **cover title** to something else.
