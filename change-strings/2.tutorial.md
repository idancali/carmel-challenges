Look up the ```chunks/{{chunkName}}/chunk.json``` file once again and open it up. Inside this file, look once again for the **{{routeName}} route** element. Remember, it should look something like this:

```  
"routes": {
  "{{routeName}}": {
    ...
  }
}
```

Now, find the **cover** element again, within the **{{routeName}} route**. Here's how it should look:

```  
"routes": {
  "{{routeName}}": {
    "cover": {
      ...
      "subtitle": "{{route.cover.subtitle}}"
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

Alright, now simply set the **{{route.cover.subtitle}}** value of the **cover subtitle** to something else.
